# Table Transformer Simple Inference
This repository contains code to run simple inference and export the cells of a table, incl. their content, as a pandas DataFrame. Note that not all the features that the official repository offers are included. The resulting DataFrame is constructed based on the column and row predictions, and will probably not work on complex tables. The repo is built on top of [this](https://github.com/phamquiluan/table-transformer) fork of the official repo.
